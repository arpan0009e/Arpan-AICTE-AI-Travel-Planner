## üìñ Overview

Planning trips can be time-consuming and generic. This project solves that problem by creating an AI-driven planner specifically for students or budget-conscious travelers. The application takes a user's **destination**, **trip duration**, **budget**, and personal **interests** to automatically generate a detailed, day-by-day itinerary. It intelligently groups activities by location to minimize travel time and suggests budget-friendly options, providing a complete plan in seconds.
